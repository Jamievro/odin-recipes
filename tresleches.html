    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tres leches is a classic Latin American dessert made from a light sponge or butter cake that is soaked in a mixture of three milks: evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream (or whole milk). This soaking gives the cake a rich, moist texture while still keeping it airy and tender. The name “tres leches” literally means “three milks,” referring to the signature blend that sets it apart from other cakes.</p>
        <p>After the cake absorbs the milk mixture, it is usually topped with a layer of lightly sweetened whipped cream and sometimes garnished with cinnamon, fruit, or toasted coconut. The result is a decadent yet refreshing dessert, celebrated for its balance of sweetness and creaminess. Tres leches is popular across Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and beyond, often served at birthdays, holidays, and festive gatherings.</p>
