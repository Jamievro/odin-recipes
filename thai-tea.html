    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Thai iced tea is a sweet, creamy, and aromatic beverage made from strongly brewed black tea—often spiced with star anise, cardamom, or tamarind—combined with sugar and served over ice. The tea is typically made with Ceylon or Thai tea mix, which gives it its signature deep orange color. After steeping and sweetening, the tea is poured over ice and topped with evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, or sometimes half-and-half, creating a distinctive layered appearance.</p>
        <p>Popular in Thai restaurants and street markets, Thai iced tea is both refreshing and indulgent, balancing bold tea flavor with rich, milky sweetness. Its vibrant color and silky texture make it a standout among global tea beverages. While it's commonly enjoyed alongside spicy Thai dishes to cool the palate, it also serves well as a dessert-like treat on its own.</p>
