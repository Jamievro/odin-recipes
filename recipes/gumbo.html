    <h3 id="Description">Description</h3>
        <p>Gumbo is a rich, flavorful stew rooted in Louisiana Creole and Cajun culinary traditions. It typically combines a strong, savory stock with meat or shellfish—such as chicken, sausage, shrimp, or crab—and the "holy trinity" of vegetables: onions, bell peppers, and celery. The dish is thickened with either a dark roux (flour and fat cooked until browned), okra, or filé powder (ground sassafras leaves), depending on regional and family variations. Spices, herbs, and often a touch of heat round out its complex flavor profile.</p>

        <p>Served over rice, gumbo is both a comfort food and a cultural symbol, reflecting the blend of French, African, Spanish, and Native American influences in the Gulf South. It's commonly prepared in large batches for gatherings, with recipes passed down through generations. Each version—whether seafood-heavy, meat-based, or a combination—is deeply personal and often fiercely defended as "authentic" by those who make it.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make The Roux</strong>. In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, combine oil and flour over medium heat. Stir constantly for 20 to 30 minutes, until the roux turns a deep brown color (like chocolate). Be careful not to burn it—if it smells scorched, you&rsquo;ll need to start over.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Veggies</strong>. Once the roux is ready, stir in the diced onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the Meats</strong>. In a separate pan (or remove the veggies and use the same pot), brown the sausage slices. Remove and set aside. Brown the chicken pieces and set aside with the sausage.</li>
            <li><strong>Build the Gumbo</strong>. Add the browned meats back into the pot. Slowly stir in the chicken stock, scraping up any bits from the bottom. Add bay leaves, thyme, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer</strong>. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally. Skim off any fat that rises to the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Taste &amp; Adjust</strong>. Taste and adjust seasoning. If you want a thicker texture, stir in a small amount of filé powder at the end (do not boil after adding filé).</li>
        </ol>
